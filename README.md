Google API for Apretaste

Internet access in Cuba is among the most regulated in the world. Most Cuban citizens have to spend somewhere around a quarter of their monthly salary per hour to access the Internet and can do so only at certain areas designated by the Cuban government, and they are typically unable to afford the cost of downloading or streaming more than a few megabytes per month. Thus, this version of Google displays a limited number of search results and then uses the apretaste "WEB" service to download a view of each web page as a PDF file. What makes this service particularly useful to Cubans is that they previously needed to know the url of a website before they could access it, whereas now they can use Google to search for ideas or concepts.

To use this service:
Send an email to "apretaste@gmail.com" with the subject "google x" where you can replace x with anything you want to search for. After a few minutes, you should receive an email from apretaste@gmail.com with an email showing you the search results. Click on any one of them, and a new email will open up with the subject "WEB url" where "url" will be replaced with the url of the website; click "Send" on this email to get a PDF view of the web page.

To modify/test this service:

1. Download "sandbox.zip" from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8BgVCFpPBzRU2lUS0ZOdVRMdG8
2. Follow all the instructions in the "HOW-TO" document. The "COMO-HACER" file contains the instructions in Spanish.
3. Copy the "service.php", "config.xml", and the "templates" folder (and everything in it) to a folder titled "google" and place "google" in (C: > apretaste > Sandbox > services).
Note: If your computer does not have a C: drive, you may be able to place the "apretaste" folder in your Desktop instead.
Note: When you run the command "vagrant up" on your terminal/console, it can take around 15 minutes to start up.
